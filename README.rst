gadcp
=====

Library of python modules for dealing with RDI ADCP data. Heavily based on pycurrents which take a couple extra steps to install, therefore these libraries were moved from `gvpy` to their own module. Import as
```
import gadcp
```

To install in regular mode
```
python setup.py install
```

To install in developer mode
```
python setup.py develop
```

or using pip:
```
pip install -e .
```
